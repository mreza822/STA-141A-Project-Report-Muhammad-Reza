If you are reading this file, then that means you have successfully accessed the Github repository for this project. This repository contains all of the files needed to reproduce the HTML file in the Canvas submission for this project. 

*Note: It may not be necessary, but it is STRONGLY recommended to have RStudio downloaded for accessing these files. This will provide the optimized experience for accessing the files, running the code, and reproducing the results. 

In order to access the files, it is important to follow these next steps with precision to avoid any errors or mishaps. 

Step 1: Dedicate a folder on your computer for downloading the files in the repository. Typically, one would want this to be a relatively empty/new folder for simplicity.
Step 2: Create two separate folders within your designated folder (not within each other). Name these folders "Data" and "Test", respectively. Remember to capitalize. 
Step 3: Download the file titled "sessions.zip" from the repository onto your computer. At first, this will be a compressed (zipped) folder. Unzip the files in this folder to the "Data" folder you created in the previous step.
Step 4: Download the file titled "test.zip" from the repository. This is also a zipped folder. Unzip the files to the "Test" folder you created in Step 2.
Step 5: Download the R-markdown file (STA 141A Project Report.Rmd), which contains the code which the HTML document is based off. Save this file into the folder you dedicated for downloading all of the files in Step 1. At the end, this singular file should be alongside the "Data" and "Test" folders.
Step 6: Access RStudio. Once again, it is recommended to have RStudio downloaded on your computer.
Step 7: In the top left corner of RStudio, click on the "File" button. This will prompt a dropdown menu. Click on the third option, which should be "Open File". You can also use the keyboard shortcut ctrl+o to access the "Open File" button directly. 
Step 8: Open the R markdown file you downloaded from the repository in Step 5. Remember to open this file from the designated folder (not downloads), or else the file will not be able to run.

If you have followed all of these steps successfully, then you should be able to successfully reproduce the HTML file in the Canvas submission.
